# Choosing Outperforming Stocks with Machine Learning
Dec 2021 | By: Logan Chalifour

This study will examine the trailing twelve-month returns (TTM) of the stocks in the S&P 500 to see if financial ratios can be leveraged to predict stocks that outperform the market using machine learning. Over the past 12 months, the S&P 500 has returned roughly 26% to investors, so that would be the return realized if passively invested in the index. However, as we know, many investors would much rather prefer excess returns by making savvy stock picks. In the past, these stock picks were made based on bottom-up research about each stock (equity research) which is a highly manual process prone to human bias. Machine learning has brought about a new wave of investing where stock picks may be automated in order to outperform the market. In this study, I will see if several machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and SVC's can predict stocks that outperform the market. The models will be fed several financial metrics in an attempt to predict outperforming stocks.
